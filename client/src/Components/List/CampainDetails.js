        For Megan Drye, our miracle, who has lived a motherâ€™s worst nightmare.
        She has survived the unimaginable and lost absolutely everything. The
        support of others will carry her and encourage her to keep taking one
        breath, one step, and one day at a time. We are living in the hope and
        peace that they are with Jesus and we will see our parents and Micah
        again one day. Words cannot express how much your prayers and support
        have carried us through this time. We have experienced miracle after
        miracle in her surviving the unimaginable nightmare of losing her
        parents and 7yo son right before her eyes, her being rescued after 3
        hours in the water, to the precious doctors and nurses who took such
        good care of her as she first faced her new reality, to us being able to
        get to her even though WNC was completely shut down, to finally being
        together to begin healing. We are truly experiencing peace beyond
        anything we can understand, because of your prayers. Sisters with
        gratitude, Jess & Heather
